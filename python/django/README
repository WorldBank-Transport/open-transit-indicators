### Internationalization

The API has a few endpoints that return human-readable text, indended for display on a client app.
These strings are translated by the django app via the django translation system and are stored in
settings.LOCALE_DIRS.

For an example endpoint, see: /api/indicator-types/

Currently supported languages include:
  - es
  - vi
  - zh

Like any other django app, update translations with:

```

manage.py makemessages --locale=es --locale=vi --locale=zh
// now edit files created in the settings.LOCALE_DIRS directory
manage.py compilemessages
sudo service oti-gunicorn restart

```
